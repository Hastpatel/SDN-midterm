# SDN-midterm
The project configures 3 routers to route traffic and establish connection between an SDN controller and the OVS on the mininet VM, and display the total count of Packet_in messages sent from the OVS to the controller using a graph on a web page.

All files are imported as modules into the "final.py" file.
The templates folder consists of the template used to display the graph on the web interface.
